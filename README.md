# remix-missing-link-load

CodeSandbox:
https://codesandbox.io/s/charming-galileo-5mcxy?file=/app/root.tsx

![example](link-function-not-loading.gif)

This repo is an MVP to illustrate a problem - routes' link function is not called (and routes' CSS file is not loaded) when page is rendered after POST-ing to itself (in this case, a basic cookie with UI theme preference).

Otherwise, this is an MVP of three-theme UI switching on [Remix](https://remix.run) framework.
